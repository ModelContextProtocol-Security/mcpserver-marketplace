# List of MCP Clients

## modelcontectprotocol.io official list

The list is at: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients#example-clients

And has the following fields: Client	Resources	Prompts	Tools	Discovery	Sampling	Roots	Elicitation	Instructions

I think we also care about "Discovery" but it's not clear what they mean by that (the word is linked to a document that doesn't explicitly cover it).
