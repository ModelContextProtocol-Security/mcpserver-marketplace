# ChatFrame

## Notes

Desktop app (macOS/Windows) for chatting with multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq). Built on Tauri/Rust. Features local RAG for PDF/text/code. MCP server support but requires manual setup - servers needing runtimes (Node.js, etc.) must be installed separately. No marketplace - users configure MCP servers manually.
