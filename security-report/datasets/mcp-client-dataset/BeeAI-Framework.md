# BeeAI Framework

## Notes

IBM's production-ready AI agent framework (Python and TypeScript). MCP native - can build MCP-compatible components and equip agents with MCP tools. Uses MCPTool class and mcp-servers.json for config. No built-in marketplace for browsing/installing servers - relies on manual config and external resources.
