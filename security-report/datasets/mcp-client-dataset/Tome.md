# Tome

## Notes

macOS LLM client by Runebook for local LLMs and MCP. Smithery integration provides 4000+ MCP servers with few clicks. No json config or package manager fiddling. Local first - you control your data. Works with Ollama, Qwen3. Runebook acquired by Keycard (AI agent identity). Windows/Linux coming.
