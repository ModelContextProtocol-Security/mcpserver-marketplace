### 7.1 Web Security Headers

N/A - This is a GitHub repository; web security headers apply to deployed instances.

---

## Part 11: Evaluator Assessment

### 11.1 Strengths

- **Curated and Categorized:** Provides a well-organized and categorized list of MCP servers, facilitating discovery.
- **Comprehensive Scope:** Covers various MCP server implementations across different domains and integrations.
- **Open Source:** The list itself is open source and can be contributed to.
- **GitHub Security Features:** Dependabot, Code Scanning, and Secret Scanning are enabled on the repository.

### 11.2 Weaknesses & Gaps

- **No Formal Vetting Process:** While curated, the specific criteria for inclusion and continuous monitoring are not detailed.
- **No License:** The audit data indicates a license file was not found, which is a legal ambiguity for a public repository.
- **No Explicit Security Policy:** A formal `SECURITY.md` is missing.
- **Limited Scope:** As a static list, it lacks dynamic features like real-time status updates or user reviews.

### 11.3 Red Flags

- The absence of a clear license is a legal red flag for any public repository.

### 11.4 Recommendations

- **Add a License:** Include a clear open-source license (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0) to the repository.
- **Formalize Vetting:** Document the criteria and process for adding/removing servers from the list.
- **Add a `SECURITY.md`:** Provide a formal vulnerability disclosure process.

### 11.5 Overall Trust Assessment

"Awesome MCP Servers (wong2)" is a valuable informational resource for the MCP community, offering a well-organized and extensive list of servers. Its curated nature enhances discoverability. However, the lack of a clear license, formal vetting process details, and a dedicated security policy are areas for improvement. While not a "marketplace" in the traditional sense, its role as a discovery hub means its recommendations carry weight, and a more robust trust framework would benefit its users.
