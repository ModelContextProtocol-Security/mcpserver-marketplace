# Zed

## Notes

Fast code editor with MCP server support via extension marketplace. MCP servers installable as extensions through Command Palette. Agent Panel shows available servers with status indicators. Config in settings.json context_servers section. Extensions require additional config (e.g., GitHub extension needs PAT). Community maintains many MCP server extensions.
