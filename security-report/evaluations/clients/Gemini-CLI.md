# Gemini CLI

## Notes

Google's open source CLI AI agent. MCP server config via settings.json or CLI commands. Supports local (command/STDIO) and remote (HTTP/SSE) servers. OAuth 2.0 with auto-discovery or Google credentials. FastMCP integration for easy server installation. No built-in marketplace - relies on manual config and community resources.
