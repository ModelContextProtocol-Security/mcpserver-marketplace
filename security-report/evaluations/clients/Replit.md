# Replit

## Notes

Replit supports MCP for their Agent feature. Focus is on MCP server development and deployment (templates, tutorials) rather than end-user server discovery. Users deploy their own MCP servers or use external registries like Glama. No built-in marketplace for browsing/installing servers.
