---

## Assistant

I've finished reading all the main markdown files in this repository. Let me provide you with a comprehensive summary:

## Project Understanding

This is a **Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) MCP Security Working Group** project with two main objectives:

### 1. **Core Mission: Evaluate MCP Marketplace Security**
The project aims to assess and rate MCP (Model Context Protocol) marketplaces on safety, transparency, and security before the first major supply chain attack occurs. The MCP ecosystem has exploded from 0 to 16,000+ servers in less than one year, with minimal security infrastructure.

### 2. **Methodology: AI-Driven Security Research**
This project also serves as a proof-of-concept for AI-assisted security work, where AI agents help with large-scale analysis, research, and parallel execution, while humans validate and make critical decisions.

## Key Documents Read

**Foundation Documents:**
- **README.md** - Accessible overview of the problem and approach
- **GOALS.md** - 5 primary goals, target audiences, success criteria
- **EVALUATION-CRITERIA.md** - 6 evaluation categories with 8 identified critical gaps
- **PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md** - Synthesis connecting all pieces
- **PROJECT-SPECIFICATION.md** - Technical requirements for 8 deliverables
- **PROJECT-PLAN.md** - AI-driven execution roadmap without artificial timelines

**Research:**
- **LESSONS-FROM-PACKAGE-REGISTRIES.md** - Applied lessons from 778,529 malicious npm/PyPI packages (2015-2025)
- **MCP-MARKETPLACE-TAXONOMY.md** - 8 marketplace types and comprehensive rating framework

**Inventory & Planning:**
- **MARKETPLACE-INVENTORY.md** - 33+ identified marketplaces across 8 types
- **TOP-MARKETPLACES-PRIORITY.md** - Top 10 critical marketplaces for immediate evaluation
- **INVESTIGATION-PLAN.md** - Detailed phase-by-phase evaluation methodology

## Critical Findings Identified

### **Gap 1: Missing Hosted Servers** (Critical)
- Every major marketplace only shows GitHub repositories for local installation
- They completely ignore official vendor-hosted servers (like mcp.vercel.com)
- Users systematically driven toward third-party code instead of official hosted options

### **Gap 2: Logo Misuse** (High)
- Third-party servers use vendor logos without authorization
- No clear "unofficial" labeling
- Example: Airtable MCP uses Airtable logo but is created by "domdomegg"

### **Gap 3: Provenance Regression** (High)
- Claude Desktop removed "details" link showing server origins in November 2024
- Users can no longer verify sources or enforce compliance policies

### **Gap 4-8:** Lack of reporting mechanisms, no vendor verification, domain validation complexity, no official/community distinction, no shared verification registry

## Key Insights from Package Registry Research

**What Worked:**
- Mandatory security (optional features = 10-15% adoption)
- Trusted Publishing (eliminates credential theft)
- Funded security operations ($400K = 24-hour response)
- Automated detection (humans can't scale)
- Package immutability

**What Failed:**
- Optional 2FA (15% adoption after 4 years)
- Community-only detection (malware persisted >1 year)
- Email-based security (email bombing attacks)

## Current Project Status

**Phase 1 (Foundation): ~95% Complete**
- ✅ Goals, evaluation criteria, specifications documented
- ✅ 70,000+ word security research completed
- ✅ Marketplace taxonomy and inventory created
- ⏳ Need to complete marketplace inventory and document updates

**Ready for Phase 2:** Methodology development with pilot evaluations

## Unique Aspects

1. **Proactive vs. Reactive:** This is a "pre-mortem" not a post-mortem - trying to prevent issues before they occur
2. **AI-Driven Execution:** Demonstrating how AI can assist with security research at scale
3. **Comprehensive Scope:** Defines "marketplace" broadly to include AI agents, tutorials, community forums - anything that influences MCP server selection
4. **Real-World Evidence:** Smithery.ai security incident (3,000+ servers compromised) provides case study

The project is methodically structured, research-backed, and ready to move into active evaluation phases. It's applying hard-learned lessons from a decade of npm/PyPI security incidents to help the MCP ecosystem build security in from the start.

# ModelContextProtocol-Security Initiative Overview

## Mission

The initiative serves as "A Cloud Security Alliance Community Project - Secure Autonomy: Hardening Model-Context-Protocol Servers & Agents." Its core purpose is providing comprehensive security guidance for safely deploying MCP systems that enable autonomous agents to interact with APIs and services.

## Structure & Workstreams

The project organizes security guidance across multiple domains:

The **ModelContextProtocol-Security*...]*

---

## Assistant

Perfect! Now I have the full context. The **MCP-Marketplace-Security-Eval** project is one specialized workstream within the broader **ModelContextProtocol-Security** initiative (a Cloud Security Alliance community project).

## How This Fits Into the Larger Effort

The broader initiative has **11 repositories** covering the full MCP security lifecycle:

### **Discovery & Evaluation** (where this project fits)
- **mcpserver-marketplace** ← *This repo we're in now*
  - Evaluates marketplace safety, transparency, and security
  - Rates marketplaces to help users choose safe sources
- **mcpserver-finder** - Discovery tool with quality/security checks
- **mcpserver-audit** - Individual server auditing tool

### **Knowledge & Intelligence**
- **vulnerability-db** - CVE and security advisory tracking
- **audit-db** - Structured audit findings and compliance reports
- **modelcontextprotocol-security.io** - Main documentation hub

### **Development & Operations**
- **mcpserver-builder** - Secure development education and templates
- **mcpserver-operator** - Operational security guidance
- **mcpserver-hosting** - Hosting best practices
- **mcpclient-security** - Client-side security guidance

### **Orchestration**
- **mcpserver-security-orchestrator** - Intelligent workflow coordination

## This Project's Role in the Ecosystem

The **marketplace evaluation work** provides:

1. **Input to audit-db**: Marketplace security ratings and findings
2. **Input to vulnerability-db**: Marketplace-level security issues discovered
3. **Content for main site**: Marketplace security guidance and best practices
4. **Intelligence for mcpserver-finder**: Which marketplaces are trustworthy
5. **Foundation for policy**: Helps organizations decide which marketplaces to allow

## Key Distinction

The broader initiative covers:
- **Server-level security** (individual MCP servers)
- **Client-level security** (applications using MCP)
- **Operational security** (deployment and hosting)

**This project specifically covers:**
- **Distribution/discovery security** (the marketplaces themselves)
- Supply chain trust (which sources can be trusted to provide servers)

This is critical because even perfectly secure servers are dangerous if obtained from compromised/malicious marketplaces.

Is there specific integration work or alignment with other workstreams you'd like me to focus on?

## Assistant

Good call. Let me think through the narrative structure and outline first.

## Potential Narrative Approaches

### Option 1: "The Open Lab" Narrative
**Story:** This is active research happening in real-time, and we're doing it in public. Come into the lab, see what we're working on, and help if you want.

**Flow:**
1. What we're investigating (current state)
2. What we've discovered so far (findings)
3. What we're figuring out next (open questions)
4. How you can participate (multiple paths)
5. What happens to your contributions (impact)

### Option 2: "The Pre-Mortem" Narrative
**Story:** We're trying to prevent a disaster. You know something about this? We need your expertise/perspective/experience.

**Flow:**
1. The disaster we're preventing (npm/PyPI repeated)
2. The clock is ticking (ecosystem growing fast)
3. We can't do this alone (need diverse input)
4. Your piece of the puzzle (specific contribution types)
5. Join the effort (clear calls to action)

### Option 3: "The Collaborative Investigation" Narrative
**Story:** We're detectives investigating a complex mystery. Multiple leads to follow, evidence to gather, patterns to find. Join the investigation.

**Flow:**
1. The mystery (how do we trust marketplaces?)
2. Our approach (systematic investigation)
3. What we know (findings so far)
4. What we're still figuring out (open questions)
5. How you can help investigate (contribution paths)
6. Sharing findings (discussions, issues, PRs)

### Option 4: "The Infrastructure Building" Narrative
**Story:** We're building something that doesn't exist yet - security infrastructure for MCP marketplaces. It's a construction project, and we need various skills.

**Flow:**
1. What we're building (and why it matters)
2. The blueprint (our plan)
3. What's built so far (foundation complete)
4. What needs building next (specific needs)
5. Your skills needed here (contribution matching)
6. Building together (process)

## Key Questions for You

**Tone/Voice:**
- How formal vs. casual?
- How urgent vs. measured?
- Community-driven or CSA-led with community input?

**Target Participant Types:**
- Who do we most want to attract?
  - Security researchers?
  - Regular MCP users?
  - Marketplace operators?
  - Vendors?
  - AI researchers?
  - All of the above?

**Contribution Philosophy:**
- "All contributions welcome" vs. "These specific things needed"?
- Lower barrier (read, comment, discuss) vs. higher barrier (research, test, PR)?
- One-time vs. ongoing participation?

**Call to Action Priority:**
- What's the #1 thing we want someone to do after reading?
  - File issues?
  - Start discussions?
  - Test marketplaces?
  - Add to inventory?
  - Just star/watch?

**Integration:**
- How much do we emphasize this as part of the larger ModelContextProtocol-Security effort?
- Do we want people contributing here or spreading across related projects?

What resonates with you? Or is there a different narrative angle you're thinking of?

## User

lets also mention that fragmented markewtplaces are more likely here since they're so easy to run/create, and by definition the AI tools can help you both as a consumer and producer of these marketplaces. also that the marketplaces will become a major target for the attackers as the impact of gtting a malicious MCP server in can be huge. we want a casual tone, and we explicitly want to bring in non infosec people, MCP users, creators, etc. "All contributions welcome"  also we want to upfdate the readme, and then also maybe make a [project name]-GOALS.md with a high level list of gaols and descriptions of them

---

## Assistant

Perfect! This gives me clear direction. Let me draft outlines for both documents.

## README.md - New Participation Section Outline

**Section Title:** "Why We Need Your Help" or "Join the Investigation"

### 1. The Marketplace Problem is Unique
- **Fragmentation by design**: Marketplaces are trivially easy to create and run
  - Anyone can spin up a catalog site in an afternoon
  - No central authority or gatekeepers
  - Natural proliferation (already 33+ identified in <1 year)
  
- **AI amplifies everything**: 
  - AI tools help users find and evaluate marketplaces
  - Same AI tools help creators build new marketplaces
  - AI agents can become autonomous marketplace operators
  - Feedback loop accelerates ecosystem growth

- **High-value attack target**:
  - Compromise one marketplace → affect thousands of users
  - MCP servers have deep system access (filesystem, APIs, credentials)
  - Installing malicious MCP server = keys to the kingdom
  - Attackers will target marketplaces (easier than targeting individual servers)
  - One malicious listing can spread across multiple marketplaces

### 2. We Need Non-Security People
- **Users see what we miss**: "That looks confusing" is valuable feedback
- **Creators understand pain points**: "Here's why verification is hard"
- **Domain experts catch context**: "That's not how our industry works"
- **Fresh eyes find patterns**: Not biased by security assumptions
- **Diverse perspectives**: Different threat models, use cases, concerns

**Key message:** You don't need a security background. We need MCP users, server creators, marketplace operators, curious people.

### 3. How to Participate

#### Share Your Observations
- Used a marketplace? Tell us what happened
- Found something confusing or suspicious? Report it
- Noticed marketplaces changing? Document it
- Have concerns or questions? Ask them

#### Explore and Test
- Compare different marketplaces
- Try installing from different sources
- Document what security info is shown (or missing)
- Test as a user, not a researcher (your genuine experience matters)

#### Contribute Ideas
- What evaluation criteria matter to you?
- How should we explain risks to regular users?
- What trust signals would help you decide?
- What's missing from our analysis?

#### Help with Research
- Add marketplaces to our inventory
- Analyze patterns across marketplaces
- Track changes over time
- Compare MCP to other ecosystems you know

#### Improve Documentation
- Make technical content more accessible
- Suggest better explanations
- Point out confusing sections
- Help us write for different audiences

#### Build Things
- Automation tools for monitoring
- Data collection scripts
- Visualizations and dashboards
- Testing frameworks

### 4. Where to Start
- **Just exploring?** Read the docs, browse issues, see what interests you
- **Have 5 minutes?** Test one marketplace and tell us what you found
- **Have a question?** File an issue or start a discussion
- **Have data/evidence?** Add to existing documents or create new ones
- **Have an idea?** Propose it (doesn't need to be perfect)
- **Want to code?** Look for "good first issue" tags (coming soon)

### 5. How to Contribute
- **GitHub Issues**: Bug reports, questions, concerns, marketplace changes
- **GitHub Discussions**: Open-ended ideas, experiences, design questions
- **Pull Requests**: Updates to docs, new findings, analysis, tools
- **Email/Contact**: Sensitive disclosures, marketplace operator conversations

### 6. What Happens to Your Contributions
- Research findings incorporated into evaluations
- Community input shapes our criteria and approach
- Contributors recognized in documentation
- Insights feed into the broader ModelContextProtocol-Security ecosystem
- Public ratings will cite community evidence

---

## Separate Document: CONTRIBUTION-GOALS.md

**Purpose:** High-level goals for community participation (the "why" and "what" we're trying to achieve together)

### Outline:

#### Goal 1: Build Comprehensive Marketplace Knowledge
**What:** Create the most complete inventory and understanding of MCP marketplaces
**Why:** Can't evaluate what we don't know exists
**How you help:** 
- Finding new marketplaces
- Documenting how they work
- Tracking changes over time
**Success looks like:** Every significant marketplace identified and understood

## Questions for You:

1. **Document names:**
   - Keep CONTRIBUTION-GOALS.md?
   - Or: PARTICIPATION-GUIDE.md, HOW-TO-HELP.md, COMMUNITY-GOALS.md?

2. **README participation section placement:**
   - After "What We've Found" (middle of doc)?
   - Near the end (before "Updates")?
   - Create a separate CONTRIBUTING.md (GitHub standard)?

3. **Tone check:**
   - Is this casual enough?
   - Should I add more concrete examples?
   - Less formal language anywhere?

4. **Emphasis:**
   - Should I emphasize the "attack target" aspect more?
   - More on AI amplification?
   - More on fragmentation?

Ready for me to draft the actual text once we nail down the structure?

## User

we also want to not only rate marketplaces, and give customers guidance, we want to help marketplaces be more secure. we want to raise all the boarts, help everyone. lets go with README.md and [project-name]-GOALS.md 

---

## Assistant

*[Thinking: Great clarification! This is important - the project isn't just about rating and warning, it's about **helping marketplaces improve**. The tone should be collaborative, not adversarial. "We want to ra...]*

---

## Assistant

Perfect! That's an important shift - this is about **helping everyone improve**, not just calling out problems. "Raising all boats" is a great framing.

Let me revise the outlines with this collaborative approach:

## README.md - Revised Participation Section Outline

### 1. The Marketplace Challenge (not "problem")
- **Fragmentation is natural**: Marketplaces are easy to create
  - Healthy diversity but creates security challenges
  - No central authority to set standards
  - 33+ already, more coming
  
- **AI accelerates everything**:
  - Helps users discover marketplaces
  - Helps creators build new ones
  - Can help improve security at scale too
  
- **High stakes for everyone**:
  - **For users**: MCP servers have deep system access
  - **For marketplace operators**: One security gap damages trust for everyone
  - **For vendors**: Brand protection and discoverability matter
  - **For attackers**: Marketplaces are high-value targets
  
**Key insight**: We need to help everyone succeed, not just identify failures.

### 2. Three Ways We Help

#### Help Users Choose Safely
- Rate marketplaces on security and transparency
- Explain what trust signals to look for
- Provide clear guidance for different skill levels
- Make security understandable, not scary

#### Help Marketplaces Improve
- Share best practices from npm/PyPI
- Provide actionable security recommendations
- Create frameworks they can implement
- Recognize and showcase good security practices
- Offer to help, not just critique

#### Help Vendors Protect Brands
- Build verified vendor registry
- Document brand misuse patterns
- Help official servers get discovered
- Connect vendors with marketplace operators

### 3. Why We Need Diverse Perspectives

**Marketplace operators**: Tell us what's actually feasible, what challenges you face, what resources you need

**MCP users**: What's confusing? What would help you trust a marketplace? What information do you need?

**Server creators**: What verification would you be willing to do? What's too burdensome?

**Vendors**: How do you want official servers represented? What verification can you provide?

**Security folks**: What are we missing? What attacks should we consider?

**Regular people**: Fresh eyes catch what experts overlook. "I don't understand this" is valuable feedback.

### 4. Ways to Contribute

#### Share Experiences and Observations
- Used a marketplace? Tell us what worked/confused you
- Run a marketplace? Share challenges and constraints
- Create MCP servers? Tell us about publishing experiences
- Noticed changes? Document them
- Have concerns? Voice them

#### Help Improve Marketplaces

**Documents Read:**
1. ...]*

---

## Assistant

Now let me provide a comprehensive review with specific improvement suggestions for each document:

## Document Review and Improvement Suggestions

### 1. GOALS.md - Strategic Objectives

**Current State**: Comprehensive, well-structured, but focused heavily on evaluation/rating rather than helping.

**Suggested Improvements**:

1. **Add "Helping" Language** - The document currently says "Evaluate and Rank" but should emphasize helping marketplaces improve:
   - Change Goal 1 title: "Evaluate and Help Marketplaces Improve" (not just "Evaluate and Rank")
   - Add a Goal 6: "Foster Collaborative Security Ecosystem"

2. **Add Reference to New Contribution Goals**:
   - Add note at top: "See [MCP-MARKETPLACE-SECURITY-EVAL-GOALS.md](MCP-MARKETPLACE-SECURITY-EVAL-GOALS.md) for community contribution goals"

3. **Update "Out of Scope" Section**:
   - Currently very limiting - should say "Initially out of scope" or "Separate project" to be less restrictive

4. **Add "Success Metrics" for Collaboration**:
   - Current metrics are all about completion
   - Add: "Marketplace operators implementing our recommendations", "Community contributions to evaluations"

5. **Tone Adjustment**:
   - Section 1 feels academic/formal
   - Could add a more accessible intro paragraph about why this matters

**Priority**: Medium - document is solid but could align better with collaborative approach

---

### 2. PROJECT-PLAN.md - Execution Roadmap

**Current State**: Excellent detailed plan, AI-focused, but doesn't mention community participation.

**Suggested Improvements**:

1. **Add Community Participation Section**:
   - New section: "Community Contributions" explaining how external contributors fit into phases
   - Where can community help in each phase?

2. **Update Phase 1 Status**:
   - Says "⚠️ Update Existing Documents" - this is what we're doing now!
   - Should mark as in-progress

3. **Add Phase 8: Community Engagement**:
   - Currently Phase 7 is "Monitoring"
   - Should add ongoing community building/engagement as separate ongoing phase

4. **Cross-Reference New Documents**:
   - Add MCP-MARKETPLACE-SECURITY-EVAL-GOALS.md to Related Documents
   - Add README.md Contributing section reference

5. **Quality Assurance Section**:
   - Add "Community Review" as a QA mechanism
   - Mention that community can validate findings

**Priority**: Medium - plan is comprehensive but could integrate community better

---

### 3. MARKETPLACE-INVENTORY.md - Catalog of Marketplaces

**Current State**: Good comprehensive inventory, but very list-focused.

**Suggested Improvements**:

1. **Add "How to Contribute" Section at Top**:
   ```markdown
   ## How to Add Marketplaces
   
   Found a marketplace we missed? Please contribute!
   - File an issue with details
   - Submit a PR with the information
   - Start a discussion if you're unsure if it qualifies
   ```

2. **Add Status Indicators**:
   - Some marketplaces may no longer be active
   - Add status: "Active", "Inactive", "Unknown", "Under Investigation"

3. **Add "Last Verified" Dates**:
   - URLs and details can go stale
   - Add verification dates so we know what needs checking

4. **Move "Status: Excluded" Section**:
   - Currently says built-in app marketplaces are "excluded"
   - Should clarify they're being evaluated separately, not excluded from the project

5. **Add Quick Stats at Top**:
   - Total marketplaces by status (Active, Pending Evaluation, Evaluated)
   - Last updated date more prominent

6. **Cross-Link to Evaluations**:
   - Once evaluations exist, link to them from inventory
   - "See [Evaluation](../evaluations/MARKETPLACE-NAME.md)" where applicable

**Priority**: High - This is a living document that needs contribution infrastructure

---

### 4. TOP-MARKETPLACES-PRIORITY.md - Priority List

**Current State**: Great prioritization, very investigation-focused.

**Suggested Improvements**:

1. **Add "Community Can Help" Section for Each Marketplace**:
   ```markdown
   **How You Can Help**:
   - Test this marketplace and share observations
   - Document security features you notice
   - Connect us with marketplace operators
   ```

2. **Update Phase 1 Status**:
   - Says "Execute Phase 1 (Claude Desktop investigation)"
   - Should note this is in progress or completed (there's an evaluation in evaluations/)

3. **Add "Completed Evaluations" Section**:
   - Track which ones are done
   - Link to evaluation reports

4. **Reframe "Investigation" as "Evaluation and Engagement"**:
   - Current language is very investigative/adversarial
   - Should emphasize we're evaluating to help them improve

**Priority**: Medium - Good document but could be more collaborative in tone

---

### 5. INVESTIGATION-PLAN.md - Methodology

**Current State**: Excellent detailed methodology, but purely researcher-focused.

**Suggested Improvements**:

1. **Rename to "EVALUATION-PLAN.md"**:
   - "Investigation" sounds adversarial
   - "Evaluation" is more neutral and collaborative

2. **Add "Community Evaluation Guidelines"**:
   - How can community members conduct evaluations?
   - What's the process for submitting community evaluations?

3. **Add "Engagement Protocol" Section**:
   - How to approach marketplace operators
   - Emphasize collaboration, not gotcha journalism
   - Offer to help, not just critique

4. **Add "Sharing Findings" Section**:
   - How do we share findings with operators before public?
   - Opportunity for operators to respond/correct
   - Timeline for feedback

5. **Phase 1 Checkboxes**:
   - Many unchecked items - should update status
   - Some may be complete or in progress

**Priority**: High - This guides how we interact with marketplaces

---

### 6. EVALUATION-CRITERIA.md

**Current State**: Comprehensive criteria with identified gaps, excellent work.

**Suggested Improvements**:

1. **Add "How These Help" Context**:
   - For each gap, add "Why this matters to users/operators/vendors"
   - Connect criteria to helping, not just judging

2. **Add "Community Input Requested" Sections**:
   - Mark criteria where we want community feedback
   - "Do you care about this? Tell us!"

3. **Add Examples**:
   - Current criteria are abstract
   - Add concrete examples: "Good: Marketplace X shows..." vs "Bad: Marketplace Y doesn't..."

4. **Cross-Reference to Contribution Goals**:
   - Link to MCP-MARKETPLACE-SECURITY-EVAL-GOALS.md Goal 2 (Practical Evaluation Framework)

**Priority**: Medium - Strong document, could be more accessible

---

### 7. PROJECT-SPECIFICATION.md

**Current State**: Good technical requirements, but very formal.

**Suggested Improvements**:

1. **Add "Community Contribution Opportunities" for Each Deliverable**:
   - Where can community help with each one?
   - What skills are needed?

2. **Make Success Criteria More Collaborative**:
   - Currently all about completion
   - Add: "Community validates usefulness", "Operators find it helpful"

3. **Add Deliverable 9: Community Contribution Infrastructure**:
   - Missing: How do we enable contributions?
   - Templates, guidelines, review processes

**Priority**: Low - Mostly internal planning document

---

### 8. PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md

**Current State**: Haven't fully reviewed, but likely needs updates.

**Suggested Improvements** (to check):

1. **Update with Contributing Section Info**:
   - Add reference to community participation
   - Link to MCP-MARKETPLACE-SECURITY-EVAL-GOALS.md

2. **Ensure Consistency with Other Docs**:
   - Check if it reflects "helping everyone" approach
   - Update any outdated information

**Priority**: Medium - This is the synthesis document

---

## Cross-Cutting Improvements

### 1. Consistent Cross-Referencing

**Add to all documents**:
- Link to MCP-MARKETPLACE-SECURITY-EVAL-GOALS.md where relevant
- Link to README Contributing section
- Create a "Related Documents" section if missing

### 2. Tone Consistency

**Current tone issues**:
- Some documents very formal/academic (GOALS.md)
- Some very investigative (INVESTIGATION-PLAN.md, TOP-MARKETPLACES-PRIORITY.md)
- README is casual and inviting
