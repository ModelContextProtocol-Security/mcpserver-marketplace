## Assistant

Hello! I'm Claude Code's file search specialist, ready to help you explore this codebase.

I can see we're working in the MCP-Marketplace-Security-Eval repository on macOS. The working directory is:
```
/Volumes/MacMiniData/Users/kurt/GitHub/kurtseifried/MCP-Marketplace-Security-Eval
```

The repository appears to be clean with a recent initial commit.

I'm here to help you search for files, explore code, and analyze the codebase structure. What would you like me to find or investigate? I can:

- Search for files using patterns
- Look for specific code or text within files
- Read and analyze file contents
- Explore the project structure

Just let me know what you'd like to search for!
