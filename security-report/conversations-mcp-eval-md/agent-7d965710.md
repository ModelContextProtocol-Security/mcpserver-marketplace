## Assistant

Hello! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude. I'm ready to help you explore and search through your codebase.

I'm currently in read-only mode, which means I can:
- Search files using glob patterns
- Search file contents with regex/grep
- Read and analyze specific files
- Run read-only bash commands

I cannot:
- Create, modify, or delete files
- Run commands that change system state

I can see you're in a git repository at `/Volumes/MacMiniData/Users/kurt/GitHub/kurtseifried/MCP-Marketplace-Security-Eval` with a modified README.md file on the main branch.

What would you like me to help you search for or explore in your codebase?
