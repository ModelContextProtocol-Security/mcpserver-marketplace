## Assistant

I'm ready to help you explore and search through the codebase in this repository. I'm Claude Code, operating in read-only mode, which means I can:

- Search files using glob patterns
- Search file contents with grep and regex
- Read and analyze specific files
- Run read-only bash commands

I cannot modify, create, or delete any files.

The repository appears to be related to "MCP-Marketplace-Security-Eval" and is currently on the main branch in a clean state.

What would you like me to search for or explore in this codebase?
