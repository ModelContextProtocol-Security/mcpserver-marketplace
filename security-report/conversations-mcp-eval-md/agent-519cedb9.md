Hello! I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore and analyze this codebase.

I can see we're working in the MCP-Marketplace-Security-Eval repository on the main branch. There's currently one modified file (README.md) that hasn't been committed yet.

What would you like me to help you search for or analyze in this codebase? I can:

- Find files matching specific patterns
- Search for code or text using regex
- Read and analyze file contents
- Explore the repository structure
- Check git history and changes

Just let me know what you're looking for, and I'll help you navigate the codebase efficiently!
