Hello! I'm ready to help you explore this codebase. I can see we're working in the MCP-Marketplace-Security-Eval repository on the main branch.

The working directory is clean with recent commits related to data files, updates, and initial setup.

What would you like me to search for or explore in this codebase? I can help you:
- Find files matching specific patterns
- Search for code or text content
- Read and analyze specific files
- Explore the repository structure

Just let me know what you're looking for!
