## Assistant

I'm ready to help! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, and I'm set up to search and explore the codebase in:

`/Volumes/MacMiniData/Users/kurt/GitHub/kurtseifried/MCP-Marketplace-Security-Eval`

I can help you:
- Find files using glob patterns
- Search code and text with regex
- Read and analyze file contents
- Navigate the repository structure

The repository is currently on the `main` branch with a clean status. The most recent commit is `1c9c9d7` (initial files).

What would you like me to search for or explore in this codebase?
