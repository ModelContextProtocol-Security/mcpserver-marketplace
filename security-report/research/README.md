## Key Insights

The MCP marketplace ecosystem faces the same challenges that PyPI and npm have spent 10+ years learning to address:

1. **Optional security doesn't work** - Only 10-15% adopt voluntary measures
2. **Namespace management is critical** - Typosquatting is a major attack vector
3. **Verification must be mandatory** - 2FA, domain verification, etc.
4. **Funding matters** - Professional security teams require sustainable funding
5. **Speed of response** - Sub-24-hour malware removal is achievable and necessary

The opportunity: MCP can build security in from the start rather than retrofit after incidents.
