I now have a complete view of the repository structure. This is the **CSA CINO Project Management Tools** repository - a documentation-first system for managing innovation projects using an "AI-first, human-led" approach.

Let me read the key files to understand the system better:

# CINO Project Management Tools

> **The operating manual for AI-first, human-led project management at CSA.**

This repository contains guidance documents, templates, and tools for managing innovation projects in the Cloud Security Alliance's Chief Innovation Officer organization. It is *not* a container for actual projects—it's the DNA that shapes how projects get created, evaluated, and executed.

## Core Philosophy

**Human-led, AI-first**: AI does as much work as possible, within the team's comfort level. Projects explicitly define AI boundaries via AI-Usage-Guidelines documents.

**Stakeholder Pluralism**: Every goal and value proposition must explicitly address CSA Organization, Community/Ecosystem, and CSA Partners.

**Living Documentation**: This system evolves through normal Git PRs as we learn what works.

## Quick Start

### For New Projects

1. **Copy templates** from `templates/` to your project location
2. **Start with PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md** — it links to everything else
3. **Match rigor to phase** — rough ideas get bullets, approved projects get full docs
4. **Define AI boundaries** via AI-USAGE-GUIDELINES.md

### For Understanding This System

| Start Here | What You'll Learn |
|------------|-------------------|
| [Project Overview Guide](docs/planning/project-overview.md) | How to structure project documentation |
| [Goals Document Guide](docs/planning/goals-doc.md) | Multi-stakeholder goal definition |
| [Business Case Guide](docs/planning/internal-business-case.md) | Value proposition framework |
| [AI Usage Guidelines](docs/governance/ai-usage-guidelines-overview.md) | Defining AI autonomy boundaries |

## Project Lifecycle

### Phase 0: Idea
- Rough Project Overview with bullet points
- 1-2 paragraph business case sketch
- **AI Role**: Help structure initial thinking

### Phase 1: Proposal
- Complete Goals document with stakeholder mapping
- Full Internal Business Case
- AI-Usage-Guidelines defined
- **AI Role**: Draft documents, challenge assumptions

### Phase 2: Setup
- Create Source of Truth hub
- Set up PM system (Airtable/GitHub Projects)
- **AI Role**: Execute setup tasks with review

### Phase 3: Execution
- Regular status updates
- Quarterly goal/business case reviews
- **AI Role**: Per project's AI-Usage-Guidelines

### Phase 4: Completion
- Document lessons learned
- Archive or mark complete/cancelled
- **AI Role**: Synthesize learnings

## Multi-Stakeholder Framework

Every project must address these groups:

| Stakeholder | Focus Areas |
|-------------|-------------|
| **CSA Organization** | Revenue, positioning, member value, standards leadership |
| **Community/Ecosystem** | Security improvements, knowledge, tools, standards |
| **CSA Partners** | Business opportunities, capabilities, market access |
| **Shared** | Benefits spanning multiple groups |

Goals and business cases must categorize all objectives by stakeholder.

---

## Decision Framework Filters

Before committing resources, evaluate:

1. **Strategic Alignment**: Serves 2+ CSA organizational objectives?
2. **Ecosystem Need**: Urgent community need exists?
3. **CSA Advantage**: CSA uniquely positioned?
4. **Resource Efficiency**: High impact relative to investment?

I've completed my warmup exploration. The repository is now clear to me:

## Summary

**CINO Project Management Tools** is a documentation-first repository that serves as the operating manual for AI-first, human-led project management at the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA).

### Key Components:

1. **Documentation Architecture**:
