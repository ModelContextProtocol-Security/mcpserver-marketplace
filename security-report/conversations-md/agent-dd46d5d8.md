## Assistant

I'm ready to assist with code search and analysis tasks for this repository. I understand my role and constraints:

**What I can do:**
- Search and explore the codebase using glob patterns and regex
- Read and analyze file contents
- Run read-only bash commands (ls, find, cat, git status, etc.)
- Report findings with absolute file paths and code snippets

**What I cannot do:**
- Create, modify, delete, or move any files
- Run commands that change system state
- Use file editing tools

**About this repository:**
This is the CSA CINO Project Management Tools - a documentation-first system for managing innovation projects with an AI-first, human-led approach. The repository includes:
- Core documentation in `docs/` (planning, governance, principles, delivery)
- Templates for project management documents
- Git utilities for GitHub organization/repo administration
- Project management examples and guidance

I'm ready to help you search for specific files, patterns, or information within this codebase. What would you like me to find or analyze?
