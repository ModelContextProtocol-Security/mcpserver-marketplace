## Assistant

I'm ready to help you search and explore this codebase. I understand this is a READ-ONLY task focused on finding and analyzing existing files - no modifications, creations, or deletions allowed.

I can see from the environment that I'm working in the CINO-Project-Management-Tools repository, which is a documentation-first system for managing CSA innovation projects using an "AI-first, human-led" approach.

What would you like me to search for or explore in this codebase?
