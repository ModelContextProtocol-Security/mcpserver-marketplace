I'm ready to help you search and analyze this codebase. I understand I'm operating in **READ-ONLY mode** and can only search, read, and analyze existing files—no file creation, modification, or deletion.

Based on the environment info, I'm working in:
- **Directory**: `/Volumes/MacMiniData/Users/kurt/GitHub/CloudSecurityAlliance-Internal/CINO-Project-Management-Tools`
- **Git Status**: Clean on main branch
- **Project Type**: CSA CINO Project Management Tools (documentation-first system)

I've reviewed the CLAUDE.md guidance and understand this repository is a project management operating manual with:
- Documentation architecture (planning, governance, principles, delivery)
- Reusable templates (all-caps naming)
- Git utility scripts for GitHub administration
- Multi-stakeholder framework (CSA Organization, Community/Ecosystem, Partners, Shared)
- AI-first project management patterns

I'm ready to help you with file searches, code analysis, and exploration tasks. What would you like me to find or analyze?
