## Assistant

Hello! I'm ready to help you search and explore this codebase. 

I can see we're working in the CloudSecurityAlliance-Internal/CINO-Project-Management-Tools repository on the main branch. There are a few untracked files visible in the git status, including documentation about agents, AI usage guidelines, and project templates.

I'm equipped to help you with:
- **Finding files** using glob patterns
- **Searching code** with regex patterns via grep
- **Reading file contents** to analyze code
- **Exploring the repository structure**

What would you like me to search for or explore in this codebase?
