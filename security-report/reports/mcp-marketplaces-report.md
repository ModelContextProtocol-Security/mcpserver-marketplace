# MCP Marketplaces – Discovery Report (Snapshot)

This report summarizes the current state of MCP marketplaces, registries, and marketplace-like directories captured in this repository.

Last updated: [snapshot generated by Codex CLI]

## Data Files
- CSV: `security-report/datasets/mcp-marketplaces.csv` (rows: 36 + header)
- Markdown sources: `security-report/datasets/list-of-sources-marketplaces.md` (35 links)
- Prompt: `security-report/datasets/mcp-marketplace-discovery-prompt.md`

## Summary (by category)
- Hosted marketplaces/registries (public):
  - MCP.so, MCP Hub, PulseMCP, Glama, mcp.run, MCP Market, Smithery Playground, ToolSDK MCP Registry, Docker MCP Catalog
- Client‑embedded marketplaces:
  - Claude Desktop Extensions Directory, Cline MCP Marketplace, LobeChat MCP Marketplace
- Enterprise/private or self‑hostable registries/gateways:
  - ToolHive (site + registry server), Archestra Private MCP Registry, Agentic Community MCP Gateway & Registry, mcpm.sh Registry CLI, ravitemer Community MCP Registry
- Registry browsers / meta-lists:
  - MCP Bench, MCP Registry Database (Datasette), TeamSpark AI ToolCatalog (Registry view), ShareMCP (CN)
- Non‑English additions:
  - CN: Langchain4j AIDeepin（得应AI）– MCP服务市场; ShareMCP 导航
  - KR: MCP Hub (ip99202/mcp_hub)

## Notable Entries (examples)
- Claude Desktop – Extensions Directory: built‑in curated directory, one‑click install of .mcpb, auto‑updates.
- Docker MCP Catalog: vendor catalog surfaced in Docker Hub and Docker Desktop MCP Toolkit; curated/security‑reviewed.
- MCP.so: large directory; open source implementation at chatmcp/mcpso.
- ToolHive: enterprise registry + isolation; separate API server aligns with MCP Registry API semantics.

## Gaps and Next Steps
- Non‑English roundup posts specifically listing multiple marketplaces (JP/ES) — continue discovery.
- Optional: add language field (kept out of CSV per current schema; can record in notes).
- Optional: per‑marketplace markdown with richer fields (API availability, one‑click support, curation, vendor, region, evidence quotes).

## Evidence Logging
- CSV includes: Name, URL, Source Code URL, Is Marketplace, Is Aggregator, Is List Of Marketplaces.
- Markdown lists provide additional source links.
- Discovery prompt added to standardize further data collection.

## Change Log (recent additions)
- Added Docker MCP Catalog, ToolHive (site + API), Archestra Private Registry, Agentic Community Gateway & Registry, mcpm.sh, ravitemer/mcp-registry.
- Added non‑English: Langchain4j AIDeepin (CN), ShareMCP (CN), MCP Hub (KR).
- Linked MCP.so to chatmcp/mcpso source.
